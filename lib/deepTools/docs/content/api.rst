deepTools API
=============

deepTools consists of several command line and Galaxy wrappers for summarizing
the information of Next Generation Sequencing data that can be mapped to a reference genome.
Through the API, the engine powering the deepTools commands can be used for other purposes as well.

Our :doc:`example_api_tutorial` explains step-by-step how to make use of some deepTools modules to achieve analyses outside the scope of the deepTools suite such as counting reads for certain genome regions and computing the FRiP score.
